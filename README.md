**Overview**
This project is designed to generate, test, extract, and analyze performance data for various system configurations and scenarios. It consists of four main components:

dataset_generator.py: Generates datasets with specific characteristics for testing or analysis.
test_benchmark.py: Utilizes pytest to automate testing and benchmarking of system performance.
extract.py: Extracts and processes JSON data into structured formats for analysis.
explore_PERFORMACE.py: Analyzes and optimizes system performance based on microproperties and configurations.
Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
pytest
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, and pytest.
Usage
Generating Datasets
bash
Copy code
python dataset_generator.py
This script generates datasets based on predefined configurations and characteristics.

**Running Benchmarks**
bash
Copy code
pytest test_benchmark.py
Automates testing and benchmarking against the generated datasets and explores system performance under various configurations.

**Extracting Data**
bash
Copy code
python extract.py
Loads JSON data and transforms it into a structured format for analysis.

**Exploring Performance**
bash
Copy code
python explore_PERFORMACE.py
Processes and analyzes microproperties to optimize or understand system performance.

**Exploring Quality**
bash
Copy code
python explore_QUALITY.py
Processes and analyzes microproperties to optimize or understand system quality.
